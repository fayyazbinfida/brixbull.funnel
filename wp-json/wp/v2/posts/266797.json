You feel obliged to return the favor when someone does something for you. The first step in the VIA framework is for you to provide your prospects with several worthwhile and practical items. This develops intense levels of reciprocity, which they typically balance by purchasing your product when you finally make it available to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Commitment and Consistency<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the commitment and consistency concept, once you do an action, you will likely defend it and take more of the same action in the future. With Value In Advance, your prospects begin by taking steps that are free to them, making it easier for you to persuade them to do so. H<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, as they continue to follow your advice, <strong>they become more likely to do so overall.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Liking<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Almost everyone has a basic intuitive understanding of the liking principle. When someone you like makes a recommendation, you are more likely to follow it than if you have neutral or unfavorable thoughts for them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving your potential customers various helpful things while m<strong>aking no requests in return causes them to like you.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Authority<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the concept of authority, a person is more likely to follow instructions if they are given by someone they perceive to be in a position of authority.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potential customers have concrete evidence that what you are selling works when they take advantage of the early, <strong>free phases of your Value In Advance campaign<\/strong> and start to regard you as an authority.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same influence is had on a person&#8217;s subconscious even if they don&#8217;t heed your advice or take advantage of the freebies you provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-266823 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/10354155_4440574-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"419\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, VIA is all about relationships, so focus on building solid relationships with your clients and prospects.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the right approach, you can maximize your results with this powerful technique, and using LeadsGorilla is one of the best ways to ensure you always stay on track.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When closing clients, you want to make sure you&#8217;re using a powerful technique that will seal the deal.
