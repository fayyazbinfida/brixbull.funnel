This new platform effectively replaced the old Google My Business interface.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll cover in this blog post:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>How to claim an existing business on Google.<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Why claiming a business on Google is a MUST.<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>The 4 QUICK ways of optimizing a recently claimed GBP entry to show up organically on Google search.\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>Why It\u2019s ESSENTIAL to Claim a Business on Google<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The majority of &#8216;local gurus&#8217; will tell you that having a Google Business Profile (GBP) is necessary for local SEO, and they are not mistaken. However, creating a GBP is also a significant step toward obtaining a map listing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Google automatically creates new business profiles as its algorithms figure out that people go to a certain type of business and they mention it online. As a business owner or as someone that helps a business owner, you should <em>seek to create a new business profile before Google creates one automatically.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you or your customer don&#8217;t have a physical location, <strong>Google verification will make you searchable and discoverable<\/strong> when you want to stand out from the crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-266811 \" src=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verification.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"513\" height=\"345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verification.jpg 513w, https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verification-480x323.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 513px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>Claiming a Business is as EASY as 1,2<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s never been <strong><em>EASIER to claim a business on Google<\/em><\/strong> &#8211; especially since 2022 after Google got busy and revamped the interface a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s everything you need to do to claim a business on Google:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 1: Create or Find the GBP Listing<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.

If it does, click<b> Manage<\/b> to move on to the verification stage. Choose &#8220;<b>add your business to Google<\/b>&#8221; if it isn&#8217;t already listed.<\/p>\n<p>2. Your business name will be requested on the following screen. I advise using the name by which you want your clients to refer to your company. For instance, if an LLC has a name that differs from the name of the storefront, <strong>use that name<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>2. After that, you must decide which category best describes your company. Most of the time this is straightforward, as in retail, consultancy, or a restaurant. <strong>Choose the category you generally use to describe your business<\/strong> from the choices provided by Google.<\/p>\n<p>3. You are prompted to add a physical location in the following step. I advise adding an address, such as your corporate headquarters, even if you do not have a shop because<em> it will affect local SEO<\/em>.<strong>NOTE<\/strong>: In the absence of a physical address, <strong>Google will request your service regions<\/strong>, such as West Chester, Pennsylvania, or Manhattan, New York. Multiple service regions can be added!<\/p>\n<p>4. Finally, <strong>you should offer a mechanism for customers to contact you<\/strong>, so be sure to <em>include your company&#8217;s website and phone number<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-266813 \" src=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/add-location.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"591\" height=\"331\" srcset=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/add-location.jpg 591w, https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/add-location-480x269.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>\ud83d\udca1 PRO TIP<\/strong>: Lacking a business phone? <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/voice.google.com\/u\/0\/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Use Google Voice.<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">STEP 2: Verify the GBP Listing<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Now that you manage to find or create a GBP listing for a business, it&#8217;s time to verify it.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that without this verification, you won&#8217;t stand a chance against other competitors that have already undergone this procedure. They will be feature on top of you even if their metrics are not as good.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Postcard, phone, email, bulk, and rapid verification<\/strong> are some of the options available for verifying your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-266817 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verify.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"647\" height=\"395\" srcset=\"https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verify.jpg 647w, https:\/\/leadsgorilla.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/verify-480x293.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw\" \/><\/p>\n<p><b>Quick Verification<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should use Google Search Console for your company, and if you do, you&#8217;ll probably be able to rapidly verify by logging into Google using your work email.

An entry code for Google Business Profile will be included in the text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Verification of Email<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, email confirmation.
