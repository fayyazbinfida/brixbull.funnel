										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most essential tasks for every organization is to generate qualified leads. But, it may also be one of the most difficult. Cold phoning and attending networking events, for example, can be time-consuming, costly, and produce limited returns.</p>
<p><strong>LeadsGorilla can help with that. </strong></p>
<p>LeadsGorilla is a robust lead-generating platform that leverages artificial intelligence and automation to help organizations find, nurture &amp; close more qualified leads with less work.</p>
<p>In this post, we&#8217;ll look at five ways LeadsGorilla may help your organization create more qualified leads.</p>
<h2><strong>1. Leveraging the AI-Scoring Algorithm</strong></h2>
<p>Identifying and qualifying leads is one of the most difficult tasks for any business organization (regardless of its size).</p>
<p>This is often a lengthy and unpleasant procedure that frequently leads in lost resources and missed opportunities for a lot of businesses that we&#8217;ve worked with. Businesses, on the other hand, may shorten the lead qualifying process and focus their efforts on the most potential prospects with the aid of LeadsGorilla&#8217;s AI-Scoring Algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>The AI-Scoring Algorithm</strong> determines the possibility of a lead resulting in a sale by examining a wide variety of data points. This contains things like the lead&#8217;s location, industry, company size, and so on.</p>
<p>ðŸ’¡ The system offers a score to each lead based on this information, allowing firms to swiftly discover the most potential possibilities.</p>
<div id="attachment_267271" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267271" class="size-full wp-image-267271" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lead-scoring.jpg" alt="The lead scoring technology in LeadsGorilla 2" width="588" height="611" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lead-scoring.jpg 588w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/lead-scoring-480x499.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 588px, 100vw" /><p id="caption-attachment-267271" class="wp-caption-text">The lead scoring technology in LeadsGorilla 2</p></div>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of the AI-Scoring Algorithm is that it may assist firms in expanding their reach outside their typical markets.</p>
<p>LeadsGorilla can find leads in new markets that organizations may not have explored before by analyzing data from a variety of sources. This is especially useful for companies trying to grow their operations and reach new clients.</p>
<p>The AI-Scoring Algorithm may assist firms in identifying and qualifying leads, as well as <strong>personalizing their approach</strong>. Businesses may adjust their messaging and marketing efforts to better resonate with their target audience by knowing the individual demands and pain points of each lead.</p>
<p><strong>This may help firms strengthen their relationships with leads and enhance the possibility of them becoming customers.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the AI-Scoring Algorithm is a potent tool that may assist organizations in generating more quality leads, broadening their reach, and personalizing their approach. LeadsGorilla is able to help organizations save time and resources while raising their chances of success by using the power of artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Customizable Reports</strong></h2>
<p>LeadsGorilla may also help you produce more quality leads by providing customizable reports.</p>
<p>One of the platform&#8217;s primary benefits is the ability to produce professional reports on demand and brand them with your own logo. This enables you to market your service to prospective customers in a <strong>more professional and reputable manner.</strong></p>
<p>You can simply build and distribute reports to your prospects with LeadsGorilla, which include key facts such as the potential client&#8217;s website analytics, social network profiles, contact information, and more.</p>
<p>You can simply demonstrate to your prospects that you have done your study and are serious about helping them develop their business <strong>by having this information readily available in a branded report.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_267272" style="width: 603px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267272" class="size-full wp-image-267272" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/business-report.jpg" alt="Example of a Business Report in LeadsGorilla" width="593" height="714" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/business-report.jpg 593w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/business-report-480x578.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 593px, 100vw" /><p id="caption-attachment-267272" class="wp-caption-text">Example of a Business Report in LeadsGorilla</p></div>
<p>Customized reports also make it easier to take use of the <strong>VIA (Value in Advance)</strong> structure. This strategy entails offering value to your prospects before asking for anything in return. With this, you can demonstrate your commitment to assisting potential clients by providing personalized reports that illustrate your knowledge and give vital information.</p>
<p>You may separate yourself from the competition and develop trust with your prospects by employing personalized reports. This can lead to more quality leads and greater conversion rates in the long run.</p>
<h2><strong>3. AI-Generated Outbound Emails</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most successful ways to acquire leads and turn them into customers is through outbound email marketing.

<p>In this piece, we&#8217;ll examine the <strong>extraordinary results obtained by a US-based marketing agency</strong> that started using LeadsGorilla to locate and close more clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The State of Things BEFORE using LeadsGorilla</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This case study is about an emerging marketing firm in Asheville, North Carolina that focuses on expanding the web presence of local businesses in the region. The agency was having trouble expanding its client portfolio despite its excellent workforce and stellar reputation.</p>
<p>They were using time-consuming and ineffective approaches like cold calling and attending networking events.</p>
<div id="attachment_267260" style="width: 989px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267260" class="size-full wp-image-267260" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dalee.jpg" alt="Cold calls leave you frustrated? There's a better way" width="979" height="923" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dalee.jpg 979w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dalee-480x453.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 979px, 100vw" /><p id="caption-attachment-267260" class="wp-caption-text">Cold calls leave you frustrated? There&#8217;s a better way</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The State of Things AFTER using LeadsGorilla</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of LeadsGorilla proved quite fruitful for the marketing firm starting with the first 3 weeks. Finding and securing additional customers resulted in higher revenue and ultimately led to the company&#8217;s expansion. Important lessons learned from this case study include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proprietary AI-Scoring Algorithm used in LeadsGorilla aided them in<strong> locating qualified leads in markets that were generally beyond their scope</strong>. Instead of only servicing North Carolina clients, the agency is also pursuing European clients.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With LeadsGorilla, they now have the <strong>on-demand ability to generate professional reports</strong> and customize them with their own branding (logo, business details, etc.) &#8211; this makes it easier to present their service to potential clients and leverage the VIA (Value in Advance) structure to their advantage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The agency had a big issue with touching base with new clients and this was evident when analyzing the outreach campaigns. Since they adopted Leadsgorilla, they started <strong>leveraging AI-generated outbound email sequences</strong> that are already optimized to achieve the industry&#8217;s best open rate and conversion rate. This allows the business to operate smoothly and contact leads in bulk with customized business proposals.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of using LeadsGorilla, the North Carolina-based agency was able to increase its profits by a huge margin. In order to avoid wasting time and resources on unqualified leads, the company <em>implemented our proprietary Lead-Scoring Algorithm</em> to quickly and easily identify pre-qualified leads. To better deploy its resources, the company was able to develop reports that revealed key information about its leads.</p>
<p>LeadsGorilla&#8217;s AI-generated email sequences were one of its most useful features as pointed out by the CFO. The outbound emails were suddenly tailored to the company&#8217;s specific goals, and as a result, they were quite <strong>successful in turning prospects into paying customers.</strong> A rise in the company&#8217;s ability to attract new customers resulted in higher earnings.</p>
<p>New customers weren&#8217;t the only factor in the company&#8217;s increased revenue; <strong>increased</strong> <strong>deal closures also played a role.</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_267259" style="width: 994px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267259" class="size-full wp-image-267259" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaking-hands.jpg" alt="Closing more clients with LeadsGorilla" width="984" height="832" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaking-hands.jpg 984w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaking-hands-980x829.jpg 980w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shaking-hands-480x406.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 984px, 100vw" /><p id="caption-attachment-267259" class="wp-caption-text">Closing more clients with LeadsGorilla</p></div>
<p>The lead creation process was streamlined thanks to LeadsGorilla. Since many of the previously laborious processes in lead generation have been automated, the company has gained valuable resources that have been redistributed elsewhere. With this increased productivity, the company was able to expand its operations and attract additional customers.</p>
<p>All things considered, LeadsGorilla proved to be an outstanding success for the company. The company saw many benefits, including an increase in revenue, a boost in efficiency, and an influx of new customers.</p>
<p>These outcomes demonstrate the worth of LeadsGorilla for firms and newly founded companies that want to expand their client base.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s revenue increased by almost 55% after incorporating LeadsGorilla into its lead-creation process. The efficiency of the Lead-Scoring Algorithm and the AI-generated email sequences were major factors in this phenomenal expansion.</p>
<p><strong>LeadsGorilla has become an integral part of the company&#8217;s operations</strong> and is largely responsible for its success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LOCAL SEO clients are clients you always want to work with. They&#8217;re usually pretty desperate, they require a whole suite of SEO services &amp; bringing them results is typically more accessible.</p>
<p>. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266826 aligncenter" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/28945834_handshake_men_01-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="711" height="533" /></p>
<p>Due to the ingenuity and strategy required to appeal to a local market, local firms are frequently the most intriguing SEO customers to work with.</p>
<p>The majority of consultants that are using our platform (LeadsGorilla) are focusing on LOCAL SEO.</p>
<p>Because of this, LeadsGorilla has evolved into a one-stop-shop that will allow you to <strong>find, research &amp; close LOCAL clients without ever leaving the dashboard.</strong></p>
<p>However, each business owner has its own kinks, so you might have to deploy several &#8216;guerilla&#8217; tactics to close them as clients.</p>
<p>In certain situations, it might not be enough to stick to the script and use our DFY templates to get the job done and close the leads you find with LeadsGorilla.</p>
<p>For situations where you need to be EXTRA creative to close a lead that you want to work with,<strong> we&#8217;ve put together 4 creative strategies from which you can draw inspiration.Â </strong></p>
<h2><strong>1. Engage Local Business Owners in Conversation</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266827 aligncenter" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/two-successful-businessmen-discussing-business.jpg" alt="" width="658" height="439" /></p>
<p>I started looking for a nearby barber a few years ago since I was overdue for a haircut. After finding a barber with excellent recommendations on Google, I went to their website to find out more about their costs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I visited their website, I was greeted by the message <strong>&#8220;Warning! Your connection is not private.&#8221;</strong> I recognized this as the company&#8217;s website not having its SSL certificate activated because I am an SEO consultant.</p>
<p>I phoned them to make an appointment, and when I was there, I informed the owner that they were experiencing online security difficulties.</p>
<p>I volunteered to use their SSL for free because the owner was managing the website and was ignorant of the problem. Later, she compensated my team for identifying further technical SEO problems, and our engagement grew longer.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this is that, frequently, <strong>striking up genuine relationships is the most excellent method to draw local SEO business.</strong></p>
<p>The requirement doesn&#8217;t have to be as apparent as a site security problem, but if you can find one, chances are the company would be grateful if you let them know there are problems that are affecting their operations.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also appreciate your warning and assistance preventing them from losing out on potential business.</p>
<p>For instance, a local company might not be aware that the address listed in their Google Business Profile is outdated. Or that their website contains 404 problems. Possibly their contact form is broken.</p>
<p>Your counsel is frequently viewed as a huge favor and may result in a long-term relationship. Once you establish yourself as the local SEO authority, you might start receiving reference business at the very least.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled whether you&#8217;re searching for a haircut, a cappuccino, or a gift for a buddy.</p>
<p>If you take the time to provide some free value in response to an SEO problem, you might be amazed at how quickly this leads to a new customer or reference.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Make LinkedIn connections with business owners</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266828 aligncenter" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/bangkok-thailand-august-06-2021-people-hold-smartphones-different-brands-various-operating-systems-with-logos-linkedin-social-applications-1024x615.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="428" /></p>
<p>A leading business-to-business (B2B) network, LinkedIn assists professionals in creating new connections and locating clients.</p>
<p>However, it is a platform frequently misused by marketers who bombard consumers with spam and cold calls.</p>
<p><strong>Stop being &#8220;that man.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Instead, make genuine contacts on LinkedIn with company owners to pique their interest in working with you.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how to utilize LinkedIn to get clients for local SEO:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve your profile &#8211;</strong> Update your personal profile with a professional photo. Include information about what you do in your tagline and &#8220;about&#8221; section. To raise your profile, seek recommendations from previous customers and colleagues.</li>
<li><strong>Post informative material</strong> &#8211; Post informative content, videos, articles, and photographs for your audience. Discuss issues, subjects, and tales pertinent to their business needs.</li>
<li><strong>Send connection requests to neighborhood organizations and business owners &#8211; </strong>Please introduce yourself without mentioning your services. Imagine shaking hands with someone you just met at a conference. Don&#8217;t pitch!</li>
<li><strong>Encourage follow-up &#8211;</strong> Send a thank-you message to the person who accepted your connection request when they&#8217;ve done so. Ask them about their current projects, hobbies, and other topics.</li>
<li><strong>Follow accounts relevant to your specialty and provide feedback or inquiries on their posts &#8211;</strong> Send invitations to connect to other users who are following the duplicate accounts as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users will start to view you as the local SEO authority and may contact you on their own if you foster real engagement.</p>
<p>Offer to assist the business owner in finding a solution to an issue if the talk goes far enough.</p>
<p>If they show any interest, this might come from a free audit, consultation, or resource.</p>
<p>In contrast to clients forced into a project, <strong>the ideal clients are those who voluntarily desire to engage with you.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>3. Establish Collaborations With Marketing Companies</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266829 " src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/focused-team-leader-presenting-marketing-plan-interested-multiracial-coworkers-serious-speaker-boss-executive-business-trainer-explaining-development-strategy-motivated-mixed-race-employees-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="425" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve discussed a few strategies to get in touch with local business owners directly, but agency collaborations are another clever strategy to get more local SEO clients.</p>
<p>There are probably several marketing companies offering marketing services in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Not all of them, nevertheless, will provide SEO. Creating a partnership could be an excellent method to white label your services or gain referral business.</p>
<p>This is how it goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for marketing firms &#8211;</strong>Â Find local marketing companies by performing a Google search. List the companies that don&#8217;t seem to provide SEO services.</li>
<li><strong>Note their phone number</strong> &#8211; Find the contact details for the organizations on your list. It&#8217;s best to provide a phone number or email address (over a contact form).</li>
<li><strong>Send a message to them</strong> &#8211; Contact the organizations by phone or email and say something like this: &#8220;Hello [name of agency], My name is [your name], and I specialize in local SEO in the [city]. Since I notice that you also provide marketing services in the [city] region, I&#8217;m contacting you. If SEO isn&#8217;t your strong suit, I was wondering if we could work out a joint venture where I recommend you for [something you don&#8217;t offer] services, and you direct local SEO requests my way. If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;d love to talk to you more about this. At [phone number] or [email address], you may get in touch with me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Others could recognize the benefit of mutually beneficial collaboration. However, agencies that view this as a straight pitch might not get in touch with you.</p>
<p>For instance, you might provide them leads, and they may send you SEO clients. Alternatively, you may provide a commission based on any new company that comes your way.</p>
<p>This may be a fantastic passive marketing strategy for attracting new customers.</p>
<p>Additionally, agency partners could enjoy a variety of additional benefits, including networking chances or chances to guest post.</p>
<h2><strong>There are No Shortcuts</strong></h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll discover that sincere building relationship is the key to attracting excellent local SEO clients.</p>
<p>Therefore, creating deep relationships is the most excellent approach to drawing in outstanding clients through networking, public speaking, forming partnerships, or offering free value.</p>
<p>Instead of making a sales pitch, consider how you might help regional companies or organizations.</p>
<p>Many individuals are open to experts who take the time to get to know them, solve an issue for them, and foster a cordial relationship.</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to work with more local SEO clients who are genuine prospects?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make relationships and promote long-term collaborations by using these strategies.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever wondered how those <strong>pins for businesses</strong> appear on Google Maps?Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or how Google is aware of their specific location, contact information, and business hours?</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-266809 " src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/map-pins.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="371" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/map-pins.jpg 512w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/map-pins-480x348.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 512px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore the ins &amp; outs of the newly revamped <strong>Google Business Profile</strong> and explain how and why you should make the effort to <strong>claim a Google Business Profile</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This know-how is invaluable if you&#8217;re doing consulting work for other businesses, you want to make a name for your company, or you have trouble bringing clients in the door.</span></p>
<p><b>Important</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: At the end of 2021, Google launched <strong>&#8220;Google Business Profile&#8221; (GBP) </strong>&#8211; Â an upgraded method for local businesses to manage their local listing. This new platform effectively replaced the old Google My Business interface.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll cover in this blog post:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>How to claim an existing business on Google.</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Why claiming a business on Google is a MUST.</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>The 4 QUICK ways of optimizing a recently claimed GBP entry to show up organically on Google search.Â </b></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Why Itâ€™s ESSENTIAL to Claim a Business on Google</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of &#8216;local gurus&#8217; will tell you that having a Google Business Profile (GBP) is necessary for local SEO, and they are not mistaken. However, creating a GBP is also a significant step toward obtaining a map listing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Google automatically creates new business profiles as its algorithms figure out that people go to a certain type of business and they mention it online. As a business owner or as someone that helps a business owner, you should <em>seek to create a new business profile before Google creates one automatically.Â </em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you or your customer don&#8217;t have a physical location, <strong>Google verification will make you searchable and discoverable</strong> when you want to stand out from the crowd.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-266811 " src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verification.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="345" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verification.jpg 513w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verification-480x323.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 513px, 100vw" /></p>
<h3><b>Claiming a Business is as EASY as 1,2</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâ€™s never been <strong><em>EASIER to claim a business on Google</em></strong> &#8211; especially since 2022 after Google got busy and revamped the interface a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hereâ€™s everything you need to do to claim a business on Google:</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 1: Create or Find the GBP Listing</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Go to </span><strong><a href="https://www.google.com/business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.google.com/business/</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create (or find) a listing for the business.</span></span><b>Note</b>: To start, do a Google search for the name of your company to see if it&#8217;s already there. If it does, click<b> Manage</b> to move on to the verification stage. Choose &#8220;<b>add your business to Google</b>&#8221; if it isn&#8217;t already listed.</p>
<p>2. Your business name will be requested on the following screen. I advise using the name by which you want your clients to refer to your company. For instance, if an LLC has a name that differs from the name of the storefront, <strong>use that name</strong>.</p>
<p>2. After that, you must decide which category best describes your company. Most of the time this is straightforward, as in retail, consultancy, or a restaurant. <strong>Choose the category you generally use to describe your business</strong> from the choices provided by Google.</p>
<p>3. You are prompted to add a physical location in the following step. I advise adding an address, such as your corporate headquarters, even if you do not have a shop because<em> it will affect local SEO</em>.<strong>NOTE</strong>: In the absence of a physical address, <strong>Google will request your service regions</strong>, such as West Chester, Pennsylvania, or Manhattan, New York. Multiple service regions can be added!</p>
<p>4. Finally, <strong>you should offer a mechanism for customers to contact you</strong>, so be sure to <em>include your company&#8217;s website and phone number</em>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-266813 " src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/add-location.jpg" alt="" width="591" height="331" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/add-location.jpg 591w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/add-location-480x269.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 591px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>ðŸ’¡ PRO TIP</strong>: Lacking a business phone? </span><strong><a href="https://voice.google.com/u/0/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Use Google Voice.</a></strong></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP 2: Verify the GBP Listing</span></h4>
<p>Now that you manage to find or create a GBP listing for a business, it&#8217;s time to verify it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that without this verification, you won&#8217;t stand a chance against other competitors that have already undergone this procedure. They will be feature on top of you even if their metrics are not as good.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Postcard, phone, email, bulk, and rapid verification</strong> are some of the options available for verifying your business.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-266817 size-full aligncenter" src="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verify.jpg" alt="" width="647" height="395" srcset="https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verify.jpg 647w, https://leadsgorilla.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/verify-480x293.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 647px, 100vw" /></p>
<p><b>Quick Verification</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should use Google Search Console for your company, and if you do, you&#8217;ll probably be able to rapidly verify by logging into Google using your work email. Keep in mind that your web team or <strong>you must use Search Console to verify your company</strong>.</span></p>
<p><b>Verification of Postcards</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google will physically mail a postcard to the address specified in your business profile if you choose the postcard verification method. There is a code on the postcard; all you have to do is take it out of your mailbox and <strong>enter the number in Google Business Profile management</strong>.</span></p>
<p><b>Picture Source</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My own least favorite method of verification is this one. Nearly nobody is at a physical office these days to receive a postcard, aside from USPS delays. <strong>Avoid this if possible</strong>.Â </span></p>
<p><b>Verification via Phone</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phone number you listed for your business can be used to<strong> get a text message similar to the mail verification process</strong>. An entry code for Google Business Profile will be included in the text.</span></p>
<p><b>Verification of Email</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, email confirmation. In the event that you select this option, <strong>Google will deliver a code to your work email</strong>. If you&#8217;re already thinking about what&#8217;s next, you&#8217;re right on the money; you then <strong>need to enter that code in Google Business Profile</strong>Â to confirm your business.</span></p>
