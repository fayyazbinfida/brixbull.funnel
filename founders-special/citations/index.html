          <p>You have to understand that most of these local businesses don't have a marketing plan nor know how to market their business online.  Yet they understand that they need to do so now more than ever.</p>
          <p>However, when they find someone that gets results for them, they'll want to deal with that one person or agency instead of multiple people.   And you'll find that most will ask you this question:</p>
          <p><strong>"What else do you do?" </strong></p>
          <p>And one of the top ways we've found to get them to ask you this question is by using local citations reports and fixing the problem for them..</p>

            <p>When you get results for the first local business, they'll be inclined to tell their friends.  And when that happens you'll find yourself getting referrals you didn't ask for, but also opening the door to more high ticket monthly revenue!</p>
